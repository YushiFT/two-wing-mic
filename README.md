Methodological Information
==========================

* Methods of data collection: The data were collected following the procedures developed by Wen Lab at Peking University, as detailed in Tang Y. et al. (2022) (under review).

* Methods of data processing: Raw measurements were compiled into one CSV with minimal processing, as detailed in "two_wing_structure_cookbook.pdf".

* Software-specific information: The dataset and codebook do not require any specific software to read and reuse, but the data package follows the Frictionless Data framework, which has libraries for multiple languages: <https://frictionlessdata.io/tooling/libraries/#data-package>.
